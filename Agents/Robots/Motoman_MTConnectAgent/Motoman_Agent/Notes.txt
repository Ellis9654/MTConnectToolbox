Decided to move   but then must lock access to interface buffer
when adapter wants them to copy.
Use boost mutex with lock/unlock
"boost/thread/mutex.hpp
	class Lock
	{
		pthread_mutex_t & m;
	public:
		explicit Lock(pthread_mutex_t & _m) : m(_m) { pthread_mutex_lock(&m); }
		~Lock() { pthread_mutex_unlock(&m); }
	};

Adapter is not fast enough to keep with the stream data.
Can either speed up adapter or put all communication/decoding into one thread
and update a robot model, which is acyclically read by adatper.

struct robot_info
{
    std::string name;
    /* items to be sent out as robot status */
    int drives_powered;
    int e_stopped;
    int error_code;
    int in_error;
    int in_motion;
    int mode;
    int motion_possible;


    /* items to be sent out as joint trajectory information */
    joint_info joint[JOINT_MAX];
    unsigned int joint_number;

    /* Cartesian pose */
    float x, y, z, qx, qy, qz, qw;

    robot_info(unsigned int j = JOINT_MAX) {
        drives_powered = 0;
        e_stopped = 0;
        error_code = 0;
        in_error = 0;
        in_motion = 0;
        mode = ROBOT_MODE_AUTO;
        motion_possible = 0;
        joint_number = j;
        x = 0, y = 0, z = 0;
        qx = 0, qy = 0, qz = 0, qw = 1;
    }
	// there's a lot more accessor and print methods
};
struct moto_robot_info: public robot_info
{
    moto_robot_info(int n) : robot_info(n)
    {
        traj_started_state=0;
    }
    // additional motoman specific fields
    int traj_started_state;
    int alarm_on;
    int queue_count;
    int servos_on;
    int motion_ready;
    int is_connected;
    virtual std::string print_robot_status(const char *prefix = "") {
        std::string tmp;
        tmp+=robot_info::print_robot_status(prefix);
        tmp+=StrFormat("%sTraj Started State %d\n", prefix, (int) traj_started_state);
        return tmp;
    }
};

MOTOMAN SIA 20d OPERATION 
To operate:
1.	Undo ESTOP
2.	Set TEACH MODE key
3.	JOINT W PENDANT must have deadman switch on side of TP ½ way down
4.	SPEEED: LOW MED HIGH
5.	COORD put button joint (robot skeleton) World (3 axis (0,0,0) ) or Tool (gripper outline )
BUTTON PLAY – PUSH SERVO ON (light should go on) THEN SWTCIH KEY TO AUTO


!!!!
The controller acts as a server for all connections. All types are 32 bit types (floats and integers, byte order is "Little Endian" (see bug write up for more information).
